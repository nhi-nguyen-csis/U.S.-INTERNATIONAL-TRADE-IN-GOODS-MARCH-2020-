# U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN GOODS (MARCH-2020)

This project implemented Python libraries (tkinter, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib) and used data visualization and statistical graphics to analyze dataset collected by The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This helps us to explore changes in global trade in the United States during the Coronavirus outbreak in 03/2020

The result of this project allows us to understand the influences of this epidemic on economic growth and forecast the picture of global economy.
